## List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns

- Problem 1: {children} is an unused variable

- Problem 2: {blockchain} parameter should be explicitly defined as a string type to ensure consistency and clarity, making it easier for users to understand the expected input.

- Problem 3: The logic for filtering and sorting balances involves multiple conditions and should be refactored into a separate function to improve readability and maintainability

- Problem 4: To ensure keys are unique and prevent unnecessary re-rendering when the array of values changes (e.g., adding or removing elements), use the currency property as the key instead of the array index.
